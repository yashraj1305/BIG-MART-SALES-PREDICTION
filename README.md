# BIG-MART-SALES-PREDICTION

Machine Learning is a category of algorithms that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic premise of machine learning is to build models and employ algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output while updating outputs as new data becomes available. These models can be applied in different areas and trained to match the expectations of management so that accurate steps can be taken to achieve the organization’s target. 

In this project, the case of Big Mart, a one-stop-shopping-center, has been discussed to predict the sales of different types of items and for understanding the effects of different factors on the items’ sales. Taking various aspects of a dataset collected for Big Mart, and the methodology followed for building a predictive model, results with high levels of accuracy are generated, and these observations can be employed to take decisions to improve sales.

In this project I used a predictive model using XG boost Regressor technique for predicting the sales of a company like Big Mart and found that the model produces better
performance as compared to existing models.

# BIG-MART-SALES-PREDICTION

Nowadays shopping malls and Big Marts keep the track of their sales data of each and every individual item for
predicting future demand of the customer and update the inventory management as well. These data stores basically contain a
large number of customer data and individual item attributes in a data warehouse. Further, anomalies and frequent patterns are
detected by mining the data store from the data warehouse. 

In this project I used a predictive model
using XG boost Regressor technique for predicting the sales of a company like Big Mart and found that the model produces better
performance as compared to existing models.
